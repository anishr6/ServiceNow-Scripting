** There should not be semicolons after the loop statements defined.
** Semicolons are optional if the next variable declaration or operation is on a new line.
** do(...) while(....); takes a semicolon.
** Function statements however should not end with a semicolon.
** function (arg) { /*do this*/ } //NO semicolon here.
** While you define the for loop, the last condition for increment does not take a semicolon.
** Declare variables before using it.
** 'gs' is a built in object - hence gs.info();
** A string should open and close with the same quotes - be it single or double.

**********EXAMPLE*************

var firstName = "Anish";
var secondName = 'Reghu';
var name = firstName + " " + secondName;
gs.info("Length of Name is: "+name.length);     //Use the length function to find the legth of strings.


** Use '\' character to escape checks.
** Use '\\' to print the backslash character.

***********EXAMPLE**************

var myCar = 'Anish's car';    //This would throw error.
var myCar = 'Anish\'s car';   //This won't throw error because parser no more considers the single quote that follows the backslash.


******* OPERATORS********

** Parantheses help execute the lower precedence operators execute first in a long chain of operations.
