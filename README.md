# ServiceNow-Scripting
Sample Codes for all ServiceNow Scripting
I am Anish. I am interested in ServiceNow scripting. I am not a geek, neither a developer who has enough handson for years but a learner. 
ServiceNow provides enough resources for you to learn scripting on your own.
You just have to explore. 
Videos like - Learn JavaScript on Now Platform (Chuck Tomasi and Andrew Kincaid) and sessions by GÃ¶ran, 
similar other videos from various solution experts are of great help.

Of all videos, what I find missing is practical examples which we face in realtime.
Of course no one tells you the solution, concepts is what is important, but there are times where you have to spend 
hours for finding a small concept.
This is a small effort to reduce your pain on that front.

For example - Demonstrate a full project where you apply assignment rules, pre-define fields, create a staging table, auto-trigger incidents, etc. This project would certainly help many at job to understand how it is done for a real time requirement. And that you don't always have to depend on a developer to understand the logics behind how things work in the background.

If you are one among the learners, please join hands.
