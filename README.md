# ServiceNow-Scripting
Sample Codes for all ServiceNow Scripting
I am Anish. I am interested in ServiceNow scripting. I am not a geek, neither a developer who has enough handson for years but a learner. 
ServiceNow provides enough resources for you to learn scripting on your own.
You just have to explore. 
Videos like - Learn JavaScript on Now Platform (Chuck Tomasi and Andrew Kincaid) and sessions by GÃ¶ran, 
similar other videos from various solution experts are of great help.

Of all videos, what I find missing is practical examples which we face in realtime.
Of course no one tells you the solution, concepts is what is important, but there are times where you have to specnd 
hours for finding a small concept.
This is a small effort to reduce your pain on that front.

If you are one among the learners, please join hands.
